# Python Compphys
Various simple Computational Physics topics handled in Python

Some tutorials on various topics, using python instead of C++, with more comments and on easier things that those from the C++ projects, with very little focus on performance. 
For example they might contain programs/problems from the Jos Thijjsen's Computational Physics book or something similar.
 
Some of them will be described on https://compphys.go.ro, some of them only here (with comments in notebooks, too)

### Hartree-Fock

The [Hartree-Fock notebook](hartree-fock.ipynb) is for paragraphs and problems from Chapter 3 in [Computational Physics, by Jos Thijssen](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/computational-physics/BEE73B0139D4A9993193B57CDC62096E#fndtn-information). See the notebook for details.

### Car-Parrinello

The [Car-Parrinello notebook](Car-Parrinello.ipynb) is for the Chapter 9 in [Computational Physics, by Jos Thijssen](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/computational-physics/BEE73B0139D4A9993193B57CDC62096E#fndtn-information). See the notebook for details.

### Python scripts

I added py files exported (with slight changes) from the notebooks. They are here for convenience, they might not even be in sync with the notebooks.
