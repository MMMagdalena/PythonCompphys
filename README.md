# Python Compphys
Various simple Computational Physics topics handled in Python

Some tutorials on various topics, using python instead of C++, with more comments and on easier things that those from the C++ projects, with very little focus on performance. 
For example they might contain programs/problems from the Jos Thijjsen's Computational Physics book or something similar.
 
Some of them will be described on https://compphys.go.ro, some of them only here (with comments in notebooks, too)
